## ***\**Section 1: Requirements and summary of development.\**\***  

*Summarize the objectives and the main requirements of the development. Describe environment and tools that you used. Shortly, describe the organization of the report.* 

## ***\**Section 2: Design, implementation and test\**\*** 

*Describe your design choices, in terms of data structures, functions and the logic they implement, for both implementations (FF and BF). Let us know what the 2 implementations share and in what they differ. You may want to use diagrams to describe algorithms. Describe how you tested your code.* 

## ***\**Section 3: Performance Results & Analysis\**\***

*Compare the performance of the 2 implementations on the 3 different provided benchmarks. Explain the reason of the differences. Draw your conclusions on possible guidelines for choosing an implementation. Please report data in clearly understandable way. Charts are better than tables*
